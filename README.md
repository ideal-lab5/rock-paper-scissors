# Decentralized Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a demonstration of how to use publicly verifiable on-chain randomness withink ink! smart contracts. It is a smart contract and associated user interface that allows players to engage in a p2p, competitive rock-paper-scissors game. In this version of RPS, both players play against future randomness, trying to beat it. It is essentially a lottery where players can guess either 0, 1, or 2. 

## Setup

1. compile contracts
2. run a node
3. deploy the contracts
4. configure the UI
5. run the UI
